  Barthen is saddened by the news and encourages the party to find and rescue the
  dwarf. He considers Gundren a friend and was excited by talk of discovering the
  lost mine of the Phandelver's Pact in the nearby hills.
 }
- Barthen also mentions that two or more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden,
are camped somewhere outside town. Barthen hasn't seen them in a tendayand expects
the brothers to return "any day now" to resupply. (What Barthen doesn't know
is that Tharden is dead and Nundro is a prisoner in the mine)

shopkeeper tells them that the Redbrands are making it hard on everyone, shaking down 
local businesses and flouting the townmaster's authority. If the characters seem of a 
mind to do something about it, he tells them that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping 
Giant tap house.
