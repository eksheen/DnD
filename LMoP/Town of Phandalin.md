 ### Barthen's Provisions
**Description:** Ordinary trading post that is open from sunup to sundown. Barhten's 
does not stock weapons or armor. Adventurer's can buy any gear up to 25 GP's worth. 

**Owner:** Elmar Barthen
> A lean and balding human male shopkeeper of fifty years with a kindly
> manner. He employs a couple young clerks, Ander and Thistle. THey help
> load and unload wagons, and who wait oncustomers when Barthen isn't around

**What he knows:**

- **IF** (Someone mentions Gundren Rockseekers capture) {<br/>
  Barthen is saddened by the news and encourages the party to find and rescue the
  dwarf. He considers Gundren a friend and was excited by talk of discovering the
  lost mine of the Phandelver's Pact in the nearby hills.<br/>
 }
- Barthen also mentions that two or more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden,
are camped somewhere outside town. Barthen hasn't seen them in a tendayand expects
the brothers to return "any day now" to resupply. (What Barthen doesn't know
is that Tharden is dead and Nundro is a prisoner in the mine)

**Barhten's News:** If the characters ask Barthen how business is going, the
shopkeeper tells them that the Redbrands are making it hard on everyone, shaking down 
local businesses and flouting the townmaster's authority. If the characters seem of a 
mind to do something about it, he tells them that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping 
Giant tap house.

 ### Edermath Orchard

**Description:** Apple Orchard

**Owner:** Daran Edermath is a retired adventurer who lives in a
tidy little cottage beside an apple orchard. A fit, silver- haired half-elf 
well over a hundred years old, Daran is a fighter who served as a marshal and herald 
for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the southeast.
Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.

**Quest: Old Owl Trouble.**<br/>
Daran has heard stories from prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that 
someone is digging around in the ruins known as Old Owl Wel!. More disturbingly, 
several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks the 
characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march northeast of Phandalin, and find 
out who's there and what they're up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an old 
watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that 
dangerous magic might be dormant there. If the party pursues this quest, see "Old 
Owl Well" (page 29).
