### Barthens Provisions
**Description:**<br/>
Ordinary trading post that is open from sunup to sundown. Barhten's 
does not stock weapons or armor. Adventurer's can buy any gear up to 25 GP's worth. 

**Owner:** Elmar Barthen
> A lean and balding human male shopkeeper of fifty years with a kindly
> manner. He employs a couple young clerks, Ander and Thistle. THey help
> load and unload wagons, and who wait oncustomers when Barthen isn't around

**What he knows:**

- **IF** (Someone mentions Gundren Rockseekers capture) {<br/>
  Barthen is saddened by the news and encourages the party to find and rescue the
  dwarf. He considers Gundren a friend and was excited by talk of discovering the
  lost mine of the Phandelver's Pact in the nearby hills.<br/>
 }
- Barthen also mentions that two or more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden,
are camped somewhere outside town. Barthen hasn't seen them in a tendayand expects
the brothers to return "any day now" to resupply. (What Barthen doesn't know
is that Tharden is dead and Nundro is a prisoner in the mine)

**Barhten's News:**<br/>
If the characters ask Barthen how business is going, the
shopkeeper tells them that the Redbrands are making it hard on everyone, shaking 
down local businesses and flouting the townmaster's authority. If the characters 
seem of a mind to do something about it, he tells them that the Redbrands frequent 
the Sleeping Giant tap house.

### Edermath Orchard

**Description:** Apple Orchard

**Owner:** Daran Edermath<br/> 
Is a retired adventurer who lives in a
tidy little cottage beside an apple orchard. A fit, silver- haired half-elf 
well over a hundred years old, Daran is a fighter who served as a marshal and herald 
for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the southeast.
Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.

**Quest: Old Owl Trouble.**<br/>
Daran has heard stories from prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that 
someone is digging around in the ruins known as Old Owl Wel!. More disturbingly, 
several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks the 
characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march northeast of Phandalin, and find 
out who's there and what they're up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an old 
watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that 
dangerous magic might be dormant there. If the party pursues this quest, see "Old 
Owl Well" (page 29).

### Lionshield Coster
> Hanging above the front door of this modest trading post is
> a sign shaped like a wooden shield with a blue lion painted
> on it.

**Description:**<br/>
This building is owned by the Lionshields, a merchant company based 
in the city of Yartar, over a hundred miles to the east. They ship finished goods to 
Phandalin and other small settlements throughout the region, but this outpost has 
been hard hit by banditry. The most recent Lionshield caravan due in Phandalin never 
arrived. (It was attacked and its cargo captured by the Cragmaw goblins.)

**Owner:** Linene Graywind<br/>
The master of the Phandalin post is a sharp-tongued human woman of thirty-five named 
Linene Graywind. She knows that bandits have raided Lionshield caravans, but she 
doesn't know who is responsible. In a back room, Linene keeps a supply of armor and 
weapons, all of which are for sale to interested buyers. (For prices, see 
"Adventuring Gear" in the rulebook.) Linene has a few scruples, however, and won't 
sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town. Among those with 
whom she refuses to do business are the Redbrands. She warns the characters that the 
ruffians are trouble and advises them to avoid the Sleeping Giant tap house. 

### Phandalin Miners Exchange
 
**Description:**<br/>
The Miner's Exchange is a trading post where local miners have their valuable finds 
weighed, measured, and paid out. In the absence of any local lord or authority,
the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to 
various streams and excavations around the area. There isn't any real gold rush in 
Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support 
a good number of independent prospectors.

**Owner:** Halia Thornton<br/>
The guildmaster is an ambitious and calculating human woman named Halia Thornton.
In her attempts to establish the Miner's Exchange as the closest thing the town has 
to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant. She is also an 
agent of the Zhentarim, a powerful organization that seeks to exert secret control 
over the North through wealth and influence. Halia is working slowly to bring 
Phandalin under her control, and can become a valuable patron to the characters if
they don't cross her. Halia doesn't know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but she has 
heard that the Redbrands have a goblin minion serving them. She suggests the goblin 
might know the location. She leverages this information to try to persuade the 
characters into helping her deal with the Redbrands.

**Quest: Halia's Job Offer**<br/>
If approached by characters she believes she can control, Halia explains that the
Redbrands are a problem. She tells how the ruffians loiter around the Sleeping 
Giant tap house and have a base under Tresendar Manor, on the east edge of town. 
She then offers the characters 100 gp to eliminate the Redbrand leader, whom the 
outlaws call Glasstaff, and bring her any correspondence found in the leader's
quarters. 

**Halia doesn't reveal that she wants to take over the Redbrand operation herself**
A DC 15 wisdom check indicates she has ulterior motives for wanting the Redbrand 
leader dead.

### Alderleaf Farm

**Description:**

**Owner:** Qelline Alderleaf<br/>
A wise female halfling of forty-five, Qelline Alderleaf is a pragmatic farmer who
seems to know everything that goes on in town. She is a kind host, and is willing to 
let the characters stay in her hayloft if they don't want to stay at the Stonehill 
Inn.

**Quelline's Son Carp:**<br/>
Carp, is a spirited and precocious halfling lad of ten years. He is enchanted by the 
idea of being an adventurer and says:
> I was playing in the woods near Tresendar Manor when he found a secret tunnel in a 
> thicket. A couple of "big ugly bandits" came out of the tunnel when he was there, 
> and met with a pair of Redbrands. They didn't see him, but it was close. Carp 
> thinks that the bandits have a secret lair under the old manor house. He can take 
> the characters to the tunnel or provide them with directions to the location. The 
> tunnel leads to area 8in the Redbrand hideout.

**Quest: Reidoth the Druid**<br/>
Qelline is a longtime friend of a druid named Reidoth. If she figures out that the 
characters are looking for specific sites in the area, such as Cragmaw Castle or 
Wave Echo Cave, she suggests that they visit Reidoth and ask for his help, "since 
there's not an inch of the land he doesn't know." She tells the characters that 
Reidoth recently set out for the ruins of a town called Thundertree, just west of
the Neverwinter Wood. The ruins are about fifty miles northwest of Phandalin, and 
she provides directions so the characters can easily find the place. If the party 
pursues this quest, see "Ruins of Thundertree" (page 30).

### Shrine of Luck

**Description:**<br/>
A shrine of luck dedicated to Tymora, the goddess luck and good fortune.

**Quest: The Banshee's Bargain**<br/>
Recently, Garaele's superiors asked her to undertake a delicate mission. They 
wanted her to persuade a banshee named Agatha to answer a question about a
spellbook. Garaele sought out Agatha in her lair, but the creature did not appear 
for her. Garaele desires an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift, a jeweled 
silver comb, and persuade the creature to tell what she knows about the location of
a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named Bowgentle. Sister Garaele believes 
that a character who flatters Agatha's vanity might be able to trade the comb for an 
answer. She offers the quest to the characters and offers them three potions of 
healing as payment for their efforts. If the party pursues this quest, see 
"Conyberry and Agatha's Lair" (page 28).

### The Sleeping Giant

**Description:**<br/>
> This rundown tap house is a dirty, dangerous watering hole at the end of 
> Phandalin's main street. It is frequented by Redbrand thugs and operated by a  
> surly female dwarf named Grista.

**IF** (Adventurer's got to the Sleeping Giant) <br/>
> The Sleeping Giant is a ramshackle taproom at the east end of town. Four human 
> ruffians linger on the covered porch, perched on empty ale barrels or leaning
> against the wall. They all wear grimy scarlet cloaks, their sullen stares fixed on 
> you as you approach. One of the thugs spits on the ground. "Well, well," he 
> snarls. "Here's a whole pack of little puppies. What do you want, puppies? Come 
> here to bark at us?"

**IF** (Adventurer's take too long) <br/>
> The Sleeping Giant is a ramshackle taproom at the east end of town. Four human 
> ruffians linger on the covered porch, perched on empty ale barrels or leaning 
> against the wall. They all wear grimy scarlet cloaks, their sullen stares fixed on 
> you as you approach. One of the thugs spits on the ground. "Well, well," he 
> snarls. "Here's a whole pack of little puppies. What do you want, puppies? Come 
> here to bark at us?"


**Description:**<br/>
Continue the insults and baiting as long as you like. The Redbrands attack in a round or two if the characters
don't. Neither side is surprised, because it's obvious that a fight is brewing.
The group consists of four Redbrand ruffians. If three of them are defeated, the last one flees toward Tresendar Manor.


**IF** (A Redbrand is captured)<br/>
Redbrands who are captured or charmed by the characters can impart useful
information. (See the "What the Redbrands Know" sidebar on page 20.) Townmaster 
Harbin Wester won't want to keep Redbrand prisoners until he knows the whole gang 
has been defeated, but the characters can easily persuade or intimidate him into 
locking up any prisoners they capture for at least a few days. If the characters 
kill the ruffians, most members of the town are grateful. One exception is the town 
master, who fears Redbrand retaliation. Harbin doesn't punish the characters but 
warns them not to cause trouble.

### Townmasters Hall

**Description:**
> The townmaster's hall has sturdy stone walls, a pitched wooden roof, and a 
> belltower at the back. Posted on a board next to the front door is a notice 
> written in Common. It reads: "REWARD-Orcs near Wyvern Tor! Those of a mind to face 
> the orc menace should inquire within." The notice bears the town's seal and an 
> indecipherable signature.

Phandalin has no functioning government, but the townsfolk elect someone to serve as 
town master each year. The townmaster serves as a judge in minor disputes and keeps 
any records that need to be kept. The current town master is a male human banker 
named Harbin Wester-a fat, pompous old fool. Completely intimidated by the 
Redbrands, he claims that they're "just a mercenary guild, and not all that much 
trouble, really." The townmaster's hall has a small but serviceable jail in the 
cellar. The jail consists of two cells, and Harbin carries keys to the cell doors.

**Quest: Orc Trouble**<br/>
Harbin is looking for someone to head east on the Triboar Trail, where travelers have reported trouble with a band of orcs near Wyvern Tor. He offers 100 gp to any group that can take care of the problem. If the party pursues this quest, see "Wyvern Tor" (page 35).

**Quest: Finding Cragmaw Castle**<br/>
After resting at the Stonehill Inn, Sildar Hallwinter establishes himself at the townmaster's hall. As an agent of the Lords' Alliance, his goal is to bring law and order to Phandalin. As such, he wants to find the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave and help the Rockseeker brothers put it back into production, believing that bringing prosperity to the region will help civilize the town.
Sildar also encourages the characters to keep up the pressure on the Cragmaw goblins. He offers the party
a 500 gp reward if they can locate Cragmaw Castle and defeat or drive off the tribe's chieftain. Sildar suggests the party might find the castle by searching the lands around the Triboar Trail for more raiding parties (see "Wilderness Encounters" in the "Triboar Trail" section of part 3).

**Quest: Finding Iarno**<br/>
After questioning several locals, Sildar learns that larno Albrek, a fellow member of the Lords' Alliance, disappeared while exploring the area around Tresendar Manor about two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar asks the characters to investigate the manor and the surrounding area to find and bring back larno-or what's left of him, if something killed him. Sildar describes larno as "a short, dark- bearded human wizard in his thirties."
Unknown to Sildar, larno created the Redbrands, installed himself as their leader, and took the alias Glasstaff to conceal his identity. (The Redbrands call him that because he carries a glass staff.) Once he learns the truth about larno, Sildar expresses a desire to have the wizard captured and transported to Neverwinter to face the judgment of a higher authority. Regardless of Iarno's fate, Sildar rewards the party with 200 gp for eliminating the Redbrand threat.
